# React Based App having a custom http hook

A React based SPA in which I have created a custom hook for sending and getting http requests. Using this hook, you can both send data to your backend server as well as fetch data from your API.

## How To Run

- Fork the repository
- Add variable `REACT_APP_URL` in a your .env file, it is the url to your backend API.
- run `npm i` in the command terminal.
- run `npm start` and the application will start on `localhost:3000`.
